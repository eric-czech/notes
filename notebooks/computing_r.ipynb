The given estimator is then trained on each of those folds possibly with another level of CV to train over hyperparameters.  Note that in the case of one hyperparameter (i.e. a static model), the **method** arg in ```trainControl``` can be set to 'none'.  The same is not true for ```sbfControl``` however as the outer CV is necessary."
