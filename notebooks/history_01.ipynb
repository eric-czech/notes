      "    - Says that a sample should determine the \"significance\" of a sample as a p-value\n",
      "    - Said that p-values should be treated as a continuous measure of significance and it was is 1925 publication that originally proposed the 5% signifiance level\n",
      "    - Said that null hypotheses are never accepted because a failure to reject does not prove that a point estimate for the null hypothesis is the true one (i.e. there may still be a difference of practical significance)\n",

      "Tukey lamented \" natural but dangerous desire for a unified approach\" to stats.  He himself was anti bayesian and frequentist in public but used both extensively in research.

      "#### Abstraction of Statistics\n",
      "- In the 1970s and 1980s statistics became very abstract (especially in the US) and this is why \"applied\" stats and math branches were created (Samuel Wilks was a big proponent of this movement back to applied settings to help with WWII)\n",

      "- Created by Richard Peto in the early 1980s (was a leading British biostatistician)\n",
      "- Said that an answer to the ethical problems inherent to treating cancer patients with randomization was to let them switch treatments, when necessary, because this would still allow for differences in treatments to be detected (but not similarity)"
