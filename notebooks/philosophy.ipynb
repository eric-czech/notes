      "### Null Hypothesis Testing\n",
      "\n",
      "- The greatest obstacle that I encounter among students and colleagues is the tacit belief that the proper objective of statistical inference is to test null hypotheses.\n",
      "    - This is the proper objective, the thinking goes, because Karl Popper argued that science advances by falsifying hypotheses.\n",
      "    - But the above is a kind of folk Popperism, an informal philosophy of science common among scientists but not among philosophers of science. Science is not described by the falsification standard, as Popper recognized and argued. In fact, deductive falsification is impossible in nearly every scientific context. In this section, I review a two reasons for this impossibility.\n",
      "        - Hypotheses are not models. The relations among hypotheses and different kinds of models is complex. Many models correspond to the same hypothesis, and many hypotheses correspond to a single model. This makes strict falsification impossible. (this happens even more with continuous hypotheses, which are usually more interesting)\n",
      "         - Measurement matters. Even when we think the data falsify a model, another ob- server will debate our methods and measures. Tey don\u2019t trust the data. Sometimes they are right.\n",
      "        - For both of these reasons, deductive falsification never works. The scientific method cannot be reduced to a statistical procedure, and so our statistical methods should not pretend.\n",
      "        \n",
      "        \n",
      "- Science uses hypotheses that don't directly translate to statistical models, so falsification is never really possible\n",
      "    - \"Popper himself saw science as being broader than falsification\"\n",
      "    - \"Science is not described by the falsification standard, as Popper recognized and argued\"\n",
      "    \n",
      "- __Falsification is consensual, not logical__"

      "- In more advanced Bayesian texts, you\u2019ll come across names like Bruno de Finetti, Richard T. Cox, and Leonard \u201cJimmie\u201d Savage. Each of these figures is associated with a somewhat different conception of Bayesian probability.\n",
